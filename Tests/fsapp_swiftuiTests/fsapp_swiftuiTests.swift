// Xcode 16 and later includes Swift Testing, a framework for writing unit tests that takes advantage of the powerful capabilities of the Swift programming language.
// Consider using Swift Testing for new unit test development and migrating existing tests as described in Migrating a test from XCTest.
// A test target can contain tests using both Swift Testing and XCTest, however donâ€™t mix API from the two frameworks in the same test.
// Continue to use XCTest for User Interface Tests and Performance Tests.
